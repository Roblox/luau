\section{Introduction}

The Roblox~\cite{Roblox} platform allows anyone to create shared,
immersive, 3D experiences.  At the time of writing, there are
approximately eight million experiences available on Roblox, created
by eight million developers.  Roblox developers are often young, for
example there are over 200 Roblox coding camps in over 65 countries
listed at~\cite{AllEducators}.

The Luau programming language~\cite{Luau} is the scripting language
used by developers of Roblox experiences. Luau is derived from the Lua
programming language~\cite{Lua}, with additional capabilities,
including a type inference engine.

This paper will discuss some of the goals of the Luau type system, and
why those goals are slightly different from other type systems.

\section{Human Aspects}
\subsection{Heterogenous developer community}

Quoting a 2020 report \cite{RobloxDevelopers}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adopt Me! now has over 10 billion plays and surpassed 1.6 million concurrent users in game earlier this year.
\item Piggy, launched in January 2020, has close to 5 billion visits in just over six months.
\item There are now 345,000 developers on the platform who are monetizing their games.
\end{itemize}
This demonstrates how heterogenous the Roblox developer community is:
developers of experiences with plays measured in billions on the same
platform as children first learning to code. Moreover, \emph{both of
these groups are important}, as the professional development studios
bring high-quality experiences to the platform, and the beginning creators
contribute to the energetic creative community.

\subsection{Goal-driven learning}

All developers are goal-driven, but this is especially true for
learners. A learner will download Roblox Studio (the IDE) with an
experience in mind, often designing an obstacle course (an ``obby'')
to play in with their friends.

The user experience of developing a Roblox experience is
primarily a 3D interactive one, where the user designs and deploys 3D
assets such as terrain, parts and joints, and provides them with
physics attributes such as mass and orientation. The user can interact
with the experience in Studio, and deploy it to a Roblox server so anyone with
the Roblox app can play it.

\end{figure}

At some point during experience design, the user of Studio has a need
which can't be met by the physics engine alone. ``The stairs should
light up when a player walks on them'' or ``the bomb should explode
when it hits the ground.'' At this point they will discover the script
editor, and the Luau programming language.

This workflow is different from many initial exposures to programming,
in that by the time the user first opens the script editor, they have
already built much of their creation, and have a very specific
concrete aim.

This workflow suggests a Luau goal for helping the majority of
creators: \emph{support learning how to perform specific tasks} (for
example through autocomplete suggestions and documentation).
